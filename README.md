# acoustics-project
Contains all code for my 4th year engineering project on the acoustics of Caius chapel

October 2024 - June 2025
Project D-jh631-1 Caius College Chapel

Student: Shawn Li syl52@cam.ac.uk
Supervisors: Prof. Malcolm Smith, Prof. James Hambleton mcs1000@cam.ac.uk, jh631@cam.ac.uk

Goal:
To assess whether any acoustic improvements are feasible in Caius Chapel, and quantify the
improvement in each case. This will be done by considering different elements of the Chapel in
isolation, such as the fabric, seating, panels and ceiling.
